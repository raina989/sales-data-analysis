# Sales Data Analysis 📊

## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from a sample superstore to uncover insights about sales trends, top products, regional performance, and the impact of discounts. 
The goal is to provide actionable insights for business decisions.

## Objectives

- Identify top-selling products
- Examine seasonal or monthly trends in sales
- Understand the effect of discounts on sales performance

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
